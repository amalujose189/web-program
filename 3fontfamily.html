<p style="font-family:verdana">A Compiler is a software that typically takes a high level language (Like C++ and Java) 
code as input and converts the input to a lower level language at once.</p>
 <p style="font-family:courier New">It lists all the errors if the input code does not follow the rules of its language.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">This process is much faster than interpreter but it becomes difficult to debug all the errors together in a program. </p>
<p style="font-family:Papyrus">A compiler is a translating program that translates the instructions of high level language to machine level language. </p>
<p style="font-family:Garamond">A program which is input to the compiler is called a Source program. </p>
