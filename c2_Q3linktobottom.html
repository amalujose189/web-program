What is Computer Science?


Computing is part of everything we do. <br><br>
Computing drives innovation in engineering, business, entertainment, education, and <br><br>
 the sciencesâ€”and it provides solutions to complex, challenging problems of all kinds. <br><br>

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems.  <br><br>
It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software <br><br>
 to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed.  <br><br>
Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert <br><br>
 programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems. <br><br>
How is Computer Science Different from IT? <br><br>

Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. <br><br>
 It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory. <br><br>
 Computer scientists define the computational principles that are the basis of all software. <br><br>

Information technology (IT) focuses on the development, implementation, support, <br><br>
 and management of computers and information systems. IT involves working both with hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks)  <br><br>
 and software (operating systems, web browsers, mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks,  <br><br>
 and systems work well for all users. <br><br>
What Careers does Computer Science Offer? <br><br>

Computing jobs are among the highest paid today, and computer science professionals report high job satisfaction. <br><br>
 Most computer scientists hold at least a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field. <br><br>

Principal areas of study and careers within computer science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks,  <br><br>
security, database systems, human-computer interaction, vision and graphics,  <br><br>
numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics,  <br><br>
and theory of computing. <br><br>
Computers have made our lives easier in many ways. <br><br>They help us perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.<br><br>
 For example, computers can help us keep track of large amounts of information, communicate with others around the world,<br><br>
 and entertain us with games and videos.<br><br>

A computer is an electronic device capable of performing complex calculations <br><br>
and tasks impossible for a human brain to accomplish. First ever mechanical computer was developed in 19th <br><br>
century by Charles Babbage. Since then computers have undergone many transformational changes in size and processing speed.<br><br>
 Modern computers are capable of taking human instructions in a form of language called programming <br><br>
 language and delivering output in fraction of a second.<br><br>

Today, computers are used in every office and institution <br><br>
for performing a number of tasks from maintaining and processing data, keeping records <br><br>
of transactions and also employees, preparing and maintaining account statements, balance sheets etc.<br><br>
 High speed computers are used in more complex science programs such as space exploration missions and<br><br>
 satellite launch. Computers have become an integral part of our life due to its usefulness into various fields.<br><br>
