<p id="parai">Positive thinking doesn't mean that you ignore life's less pleasant situations. 
Positive thinking just means that you approach unpleasantness in a more positive 
and productive way. You think the best is going to happen, not the worst.

Positive thinking often starts with self-talk. Self-talk is the endless stream of
 unspoken thoughts that run through your head. These automatic thoughts can be positive
 or negative. Some of your self-talk comes from logic and reason. Other self-talk may
 arise from misconceptions that you create because of lack of information or
 expectations due to preconceived ideas of what may happen.</p>
